Overview
The Smart Traffic Management System is a Python-based project designed to optimize traffic flow by adjusting signal timings based on real-time traffic data. The system uses machine learning algorithms for traffic prediction, smart traffic light optimization, and anomaly detection to enhance urban mobility.

Features
Traffic Prediction: Predict traffic conditions using machine learning models.
Smart Traffic Light Optimization: Dynamically adjust signal timings based on traffic flow.
Anomaly Detection: Detect mishaps and congestion for improved traffic management.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes a simple Pygame interface for visualization.
Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-link>
cd <repository-folder>
2. Create a Conda Environment
If you don't have conda installed, you can download and install it from Anaconda.

bash
Copy
Edit
conda create --name traffic_system python=3.8
conda activate traffic_system
3. Install Required Libraries
To install the necessary Python libraries, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file contains a list of all the required libraries, including:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
pygame
matplotlib
tensorflow (for deep learning models)
4. Activate the Conda Environment
Ensure you activate the conda environment before running the app.

bash
Copy
Edit
conda activate traffic_system
5. Running the Application
Once your environment is set up and activated, you can run the system:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
This will start the system and you will be able to interact with the traffic management application through the terminal interface.
